# BTCPay Plugin for aMember Pro

BTCPay Server is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin (on-chain and via the Lightning Network) and altcoins directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

If you do not already have a BTCPay server account, please [choose a deployment method](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/FAQ/Deployment/).

This plugin uses the latest BTCPay Server Greenfield API, and provides enhanced features vs the default aMember BTCPay Server plugin (which uses the legacy BitPay API).

Supports recurring billing (via aMember Manual Rebills) and refunds (via BTCPay Pull Payments).
